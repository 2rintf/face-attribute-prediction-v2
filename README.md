# Face-Attribute-Prediction-v2  
Fae attribute prediction with multi-Task Learning.  

*UNDONE*

## To-Do  

- [ ] Rewrite the training script of v1. 
- [ ] Modify the approach of calculating the accuracy of classification.  
- [ ] Re-train the v1-style network with ResNet-34 and new design of subtask.  
- [ ] Train the new network with **Uncertain Weight**.
